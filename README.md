# BlazeMeter Service Virtualization MCP Server

The BlazeMeter Service Virtualization MCP Server connects AI tools directly to BlazeMeter's Service Virtualization platform. 
This gives AI agents, assistants, and chatbots the ability to manage complete workflows from creation of transactions 
to deploying it to the virtual service. All through natural language interactions.

## Use Cases

- **Service Management**: Create and manage services.
- **Transaction Management**: Create, validate, manage HTTP and Messaging transactions.
- **Action Management**: Create, read, list, update, delete, and reorder transaction actions (Http calls, Webhooks, and State Updates).
- **Asset Management**: Upload assets (certificates and keystores).
- **Sandbox Management**: Attach HTTP transaction and test it.
- **Location Management**: List available locations.
- **Configuration Management**: Create and manage configurations for virtual services.
- **Virtual Service Management**: Create, modify, deploy, stop a virtual service, track its status.
- **Messaging Virtual Service Management**: Create, deploy, and manage messaging virtual services across IBM MQ, ActiveMQ, and Kafka brokers.
- **Recording Management**: Capture live broker traffic into recordings and replay them via messaging virtual services.
- **Virtual Service Templates Management**: Create, modify, create from the virtual service, apply to a virtual service.
- **Test Data Management**: Create, update, and read TDM datasets and global variables for virtual services to drive data-driven transaction matching.
- **Stateful Virtual Services**: Store, update, and delete service data and maintain global counters with State Update actions; verify state changes in the sandbox, then inspect, export, and reset the live state of a virtual service.
- **Blueprint Management**: Browse BlazeMeter blueprints and apply them to a service.

### **Test Data Management**
**What it does:** Creates and manages TDM (Test Data Manager) datasets that drive data-driven transaction matching. Dataset fields are referenced in transaction DSLs using `${fieldName}` syntax.

| Action              | What you get                                                                     |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create from schema  | Creates a dataset by defining entities with field names and generator expressions |
| Create from CSV     | Creates a dataset from a local CSV file; entity name is `{stem}_csv`, fields use `valueOfCSV` generators |
| List                | Lists data-model assets in a workspace                                           |

| Update              | Replaces entities/fields on an existing schema-based dataset                     |
| Update from CSV     | Rebuilds a CSV-based dataset from a local CSV file; supports field name remapping |
| Read global variables | Reads the service's global variables (global-scope parameters such as counters) |
| Set global variables  | Replaces the service's global variables, used as initial values for stateful virtual services |

---

### **Virtual Service State Management**
**What it does:** Inspects and resets the service data of a stateful virtual service. A virtual service becomes stateful when its transactions have State Update actions. State belongs to the virtual service, is shared by all of its clients, and persists across stop and start.

| Action            | What you get                                                                                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read data         | Reads the virtual service's service data: download links, global variables, and data settings        |
| Export data       | Exports the running virtual service's current (state-modified) dataset; returns a tracking id        |
| Reset             | Reconfigures the running virtual service and regenerates its service data, discarding state changes |
| Set data settings | Switches between the default NO_SQL data mode and SQL mode, which adds a bootstrap script (e.g. views) |

---

### **Blueprint Management**
**What it does:** Browses BlazeMeter blueprints (ready-made services with transactions and service data) and applies them to a service.

| Action            | What you get                                                                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List blueprints   | Lists blueprints, filtered by keyword or tags                                                    |
| Read a blueprint  | Reads blueprint details, optionally including its transactions                                   |
| List transactions | Lists a blueprint's transactions with their DSL and processing actions                           |
| Apply a blueprint | Creates the blueprint's transactions (and service data) in an existing or new service            |

### Building a stateful virtual service

A typical end-to-end flow an AI assistant can run with these tools:

1. **Seed the data:** `virtual_services_test_data` → `create_from_schema` with the data entities and `global_variables` (e.g. `{"order_counter": "0"}`).
2. **Define the transactions:** `virtual_services_http_transaction` → `create` a `POST /orders` transaction and a `GET /orders/{id}` transaction whose response reads the stored rows with `${#each (blazeData 'orders' 'where …')}`.
3. **Make it stateful:** `virtual_services_action` → `create_state_update` on the POST transaction (store the order, increment `order_counter`). For a global variable the definition is `{"model": "", "filters": [], "parameters": [{"key": "order_counter", "value": "1"}], "objectAction": "INCREMENT_VALUE"}` (or `UPDATE_VALUE` to set it). For a data entity, `read` an existing data-entity State Update action first and copy its definition.
4. **Verify in the sandbox:** `virtual_services_sandbox` → `init` + `test_request` the POST, check `dataset_state`, then `init` + `test_request` the GET.
5. **Deploy:** `virtual_services_virtual_service` → `create` + `deploy`.
6. **Inspect or reset:** `virtual_services_state` → `export_data` (track it) + `read_data`, or `reset`.

### Enabling or Disabling MCP Tools

The MCP server supports enabling or disabling specific tools at startup using the environment variable MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS.
If the environment variable is not set or is an empty string, all available tools are automatically enabled.

To enable only certain tools, set the environment variable to a comma-separated list of tool names.

Example:
MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS="blazemeter_user,blazemeter_account,virtual_services_virtual_service"

---

### Observability (OpenTelemetry)

The server emits one trace span per MCP tool call using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). By default it exports over **gRPC** to the Perforce collector at `https://grpc.public.prd.shared.perforce.com`. No configuration is needed for shipped releases; set `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` (or `--no-telemetry`) to turn it off.

**Override the destination — environment variable:**

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317   # gRPC (insecure for localhost)
sv-mcp --mcp
```

**Override the destination — CLI argument (binary / uvx):**

```bash
sv-mcp --mcp --otel-endpoint http://localhost:4317
```

The transport is always **gRPC** (OTLP/HTTP is not used). `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` / `--otel-endpoint` overrides only the *destination URL*, not the protocol — and an `http://` scheme there simply means an insecure (no-TLS) gRPC channel, so always target the collector's gRPC port (`4317`), never its HTTP port (`4318`).

> A local verification stack (collector + Jaeger + Prometheus + Grafana) lives in [`integration/telemetry/`](integration/telemetry/) — `docker compose up`, then point the server at `http://localhost:4317`.

**Passing authentication headers:**

```bash
# env var (comma-separated key=value pairs)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-token"

# CLI flag (repeatable)
sv-mcp --mcp \
  --otel-endpoint http://your-collector:4318 \
  --otel-headers "Authorization=Bearer your-token" \
  --otel-headers "X-Dataset=sv-mcp"
```

**Disable tracing entirely:**

```bash
# env var
export OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true

# CLI flag
sv-mcp --mcp --no-telemetry
```

Each span includes:
- `gen_ai.tool.name` — MCP tool name (e.g. `virtual_services_http_transaction`)
- `mcp.tool.action` — action dispatched (e.g. `create_and_test`)
- `mcp.client.name` / `mcp.client.version` — MCP client identity from the initialize handshake (when provided)
- `error.type` — set on failure (`auth_failed`, `not_found`, `rate_limited`, `server_error`, `timeout`, `tool_error`, `api_error`)

**W3C Trace Context propagation:** if your MCP client passes `traceparent`/`tracestate` in `_meta`, spans are linked to the parent trace automatically.

**SDK availability by deployment:**

The SDK is bundled in every deployment and exports to the Perforce gRPC collector by default — nothing extra is required to get tracing. Override only if you want a different destination:

| Deployment | OTel SDK bundled | To redirect / disable |
|---|---|---|
| Docker image | ✅ Yes | `-e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=...` or `-e OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` |
| Standalone binary | ✅ Yes | `--otel-endpoint URL` / `--no-telemetry` |
| uvx | ✅ Yes | `--otel-endpoint URL` / `--no-telemetry` |

**Docker (redirect to your own collector):**

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -e API_KEY_ID=your_key_id \
  -e API_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret \
  -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://your-collector:4317 \
  sv-mcp
```

**uvx:**

```bash
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/Blazemeter/sv-mcp.git" sv-mcp \
  --otel-endpoint http://your-collector:4317
```

The server never crashes if the endpoint is unreachable or the SDK is not installed.

### **MCP Client Configuration using uvx (Recommended)**

[uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) installs and runs the package in an isolated environment — no manual setup required.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blazemeter-sv": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from", "git+https://github.com/Blazemeter/sv-mcp.git",
        "sv-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY_PATH": "/path/to/api-key.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To pin a specific version or branch, change the `--from` value:
- Tag: `git+https://github.com/Blazemeter/sv-mcp.git@v1.0.4`
- Branch: `git+https://github.com/Blazemeter/sv-mcp.git@main`

---

### **MCP Client Configuration for Local testing using VS Code or Claude Desktop**
   1. Run main.py with --mcp flag
   2. Configure your MCP client with the following settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "virtual services mcp": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "path to your python interpreter /.../venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "path to project main.py /.../sv_mcp/main.py",
        "--mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY_PATH": "path to api key file /.../api-key.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Format of the Api key file  
          
```json
{
  "id": "your_api_key_id",
  "secret": "your_api_key_secret"
}
```
## Docker Support

### **MCP Client Configuration for Docker**
 Build dokcer image using the following command:
 ```docker build . -t vs-mcp:latest ```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Docker BlazeMeter MCP": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "API_KEY_ID=your_api_key_id",
        "-e",
        "API_KEY_SECRET=your_api_key_secret",
        "-e",
        "SOURCE_WORKING_DIRECTORY=/tmp",
        "-e",
        "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://your-collector:4318",
        "-v",
        "/host/path/to/your/test/files:/tmp",
        "us-docker.pkg.dev/verdant-bulwark-278/sv-mcp/sv-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Windows OS, paths must use backslashes (`\`) and be properly escaped as double backslashes (`\\`) in the JSON configuration.
> E.g.: `C:\\User\\Desktop\\mcp_test_folder`

> [!NOTE]
> In order to obtain the `API_KEY_ID` and`API_KEY_SECRET` refere to [BlazeMeter API keys](https://help.blazemeter.com/docs/guide/api-blazemeter-api-keys.html)
